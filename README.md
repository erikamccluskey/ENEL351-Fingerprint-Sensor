# Fingerprint security system

## Project Summary
Our system models a fingerprint security system and is programmed in C operating an LCD display, a USART fingerprint sensor, a buzzer, LEDs, and buttons. 

## System Functionalities 
- Has a sound sensor to sense sound when scanning the fingerprint
- Verify a fingerprint
- Add a fingerprint to the system
- Reset the system
- Display status of the scan to the user on an LCD display
- Display the status of the scan to the user via a red / green LED
- Notify the status of a successful scan to the user by sounding a buzzer

Project was completed by myself, Erika McCluskey, and Hayden Jin for a microcontroller system design course at the University of Regina. Some helper files provided by the USART fingerprint sensor docs were used for this project.
